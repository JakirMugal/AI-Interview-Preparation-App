Unit: Data Engineer

LONG-ANSWER:
1. Q: Jakir, can you walk us through how you designed the unified web‑scraping pipeline for Alternative Path, especially how you handled fault tolerance and scalability across multiple APIs and HTML endpoints?
 A: I started by abstracting each source into a connector class that implements a standard fetch() method. For APIs I used requests with retry logic and exponential backoff; for HTML I leveraged Selenium with headless browsers and Playwright for dynamic content. I queued jobs in a Redis-backed Celery worker pool to parallelize requests and used a circuit‑breaker pattern to isolate failing endpoints. Data was streamed into a staging S3 bucket, then processed by a Python ETL that performed validation and deduplication before persisting to PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy. Monitoring was set up with Prometheus metrics and alerts for latency spikes or 5xx errors. This architecture allowed horizontal scaling by adding worker nodes and ensured graceful degradation when any source failed.

2. Q: Describe the end‑to‑end process you used to convert unstructured PDFs and images into structured data, referencing your Intelligent Document Parsing project.
 A: First, I extracted text using Tesseract OCR for scanned PDFs and pdfminer for digital PDFs. For images containing tables or charts, I applied OpenCV to detect table grids and used Camelot or Tabula to parse them. I then fed the extracted text into a fine‑tuned GPT‑4 model via LangChain to summarize content and identify key entities. The structured output was validated against a schema and stored in Snowflake. I also built a fallback rule‑based extractor for documents that the LLM struggled with. Finally, I logged extraction confidence scores to flag low‑quality records for manual review.

3. Q: How did you migrate data from a legacy MySQL database to Snowflake using SQLAlchemy, and what steps did you take to ensure data consistency and query performance?
 A: I mapped MySQL tables to SQLAlchemy ORM models and used a bulk‑load script to read chunks into Pandas DataFrames. I then used Snowflake's Python connector to stage the DataFrames into external tables via S3. After staging, I executed COPY INTO commands with appropriate file formats and partitioning on key columns. To maintain consistency, I wrapped the migration in a transaction and performed checksum comparisons between source and target rows. For performance, I created clustering keys on high‑cardinality columns and materialized views on frequently joined tables. I also scheduled nightly refreshes and monitored query latency with Snowflake's Query Profile.

4. Q: Explain how you integrated sentiment analysis into your ETL pipeline, including model selection, feature extraction, and downstream reporting.
 A: I chose Hugging Face's DistilBERT fine‑tuned for sentiment, loading it via the transformers library. Text features were tokenized and passed through the model to obtain polarity scores. I then aggregated scores per document and stored them in a Snowflake dimension table. The ETL updated a dashboard in Power BI that visualized sentiment trends over time. To keep the pipeline lightweight, I cached model outputs in Redis and refreshed them only when new data arrived. This approach allowed near‑real‑time sentiment insights for portfolio managers.

5. Q: Jakir, how did you automate the distribution of daily reports via email with HTML tables and S3 bucket integration while ensuring security and compliance?
 A: I generated HTML tables using great_tables and embedded them in an email body constructed with Python's email.mime. The email was sent through SES with TLS encryption and IAM roles restricting access. Report files were uploaded to a private S3 bucket with server‑side encryption and signed URLs that expire after 24 hours. I logged each send event to CloudWatch and used a Lambda function to trigger the pipeline on a schedule. Compliance was ensured by storing audit logs in a separate S3 bucket and rotating credentials via Secrets Manager.

6. Q: What challenges do you face when handling time‑series data in a data engineering context, and how would you design a pipeline to ingest, store, and query such data efficiently?
 A: Time‑series data requires high ingestion throughput, precise timestamp handling, and efficient compression. I use Kafka for real‑time ingestion, then stream into Snowflake with micro‑batching. Data is partitioned by year/month and clustered on the timestamp column to accelerate range queries. I apply window functions in Snowflake for trend analysis and store aggregated metrics in a separate fact table. For long‑term retention, I archive older partitions to S3 using Snowflake's external tables. Monitoring is done via Snowflake's Query History and custom dashboards in Tableau.

7. Q: How would you monitor and alert on data pipeline failures in a production environment, including logging, metrics, and alerting mechanisms?
 A: I instrument pipelines with structured logging (JSON) and emit metrics to Prometheus. Each ETL step publishes a status metric (success/failure, latency). I set up Grafana dashboards and alert rules for error rates exceeding 5% or latency above the 95th percentile. For critical failures, I trigger PagerDuty alerts. I also use Airflow's built‑in SLA and retry policies to automatically recover transient issues. All logs are forwarded to ELK for long‑term analysis.

8. Q: Describe how you would design a data lake architecture using Amazon S3 and Glue, including cataloging, partitioning, and data quality checks.
 A: I create a raw bucket for ingestion and a curated bucket for processed data. Glue crawlers automatically populate the Data Catalog with schemas inferred from Parquet files. I partition data by date and source to enable efficient pruning. For quality, I implement Glue ETL jobs that validate schema, check for nulls, and enforce business rules, writing violations to a separate audit table. I also schedule Glue workflows to run nightly, and use AWS Lake Formation to control fine‑grained access.

9. Q: Jakir, how do you optimize SQL queries for large datasets in Snowflake, particularly using clustering keys, materialized views, and caching?
 A: I first analyze query patterns and identify high‑cardinality columns for clustering keys to reduce pruning overhead. I create materialized views on frequently joined tables to materialize expensive joins. Snowflake's result caching automatically serves repeated queries, so I ensure queries are deterministic to benefit from it. I also use the Snowflake query profile to spot full scans and rewrite them with semi‑joins or approximate aggregations. Finally, I monitor cache hit ratios and adjust clustering depth accordingly.

10. Q: Explain how you would integrate a churn prediction model into a data pipeline to serve predictions in real‑time or batch.
 A: For batch, I schedule a nightly job that pulls the latest user activity from PostgreSQL, transforms features with a pre‑trained Random Forest model stored in S3, and writes predictions to a Snowflake fact table. For real‑time, I expose the model via a FastAPI endpoint behind an API Gateway, using a lightweight ONNX or pickle file. The pipeline streams user events into Kafka, which triggers the API to compute a prediction and writes the result back to a Redis cache for quick lookup by downstream services. I monitor prediction drift by comparing recent scores to historical baselines.

11. Q: Jakir, can you discuss how you would handle schema evolution in a data lake when new columns are added to source data?
 A: I use Glue's schema versioning to track changes and automatically update the Data Catalog. When new columns appear, I add them to the target Parquet schema with default values or nulls. I also maintain a transformation layer that maps legacy columns to the new schema, ensuring backward compatibility. For downstream consumers, I provide a view that abstracts the evolving schema, exposing only stable columns. I schedule periodic data quality checks to flag missing or unexpected columns.

12. Q: Describe how you would implement data lineage tracking across your ETL processes.
 A: I instrument each ETL step with metadata tags that capture source, transformation logic, and destination. I store lineage records in a dedicated Snowflake table, linking job IDs to source tables and target tables. I expose this metadata via a custom UI built with Streamlit, allowing stakeholders to trace data flow. Additionally, I integrate with Apache Atlas for governance and use Airflow's XComs to propagate lineage information automatically.
