Unit: Databases

LONG-ANSWER:
1. Q: Describe your experience with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.  What are some key differences between these systems, and how do you choose which one to use for a particular project?
 A: I have experience working with both PostgreSQL and MySQL. PostgreSQL is known for its strong SQL compliance, advanced features like JSON support and extensions, and robust data integrity. MySQL is simpler to set up and manage, often favored for web applications due to its speed and scalability.  My choice depends on the project's needs. For complex data models requiring advanced features, I'd choose PostgreSQL. For simpler applications prioritizing speed and scalability, MySQL might be more suitable.

2. Q: You've mentioned using Snowflake in your experience. Can you elaborate on the benefits of using a cloud-based data warehouse like Snowflake compared to traditional on-premise solutions?
 A: Snowflake's cloud-based architecture offers several advantages. It provides scalability on demand, allowing me to easily adjust resources based on workload needs. Its pay-as-you-go pricing model is cost-effective, especially for projects with fluctuating data volumes. Snowflake also excels in data sharing and collaboration, enabling secure data access and sharing with external partners.

3. Q: Explain your approach to designing a database schema. What factors do you consider when deciding on table structures, relationships, and data types?
 A: Designing a schema involves careful consideration of the data's nature and how it will be used. I start by identifying entities and their attributes, then define tables based on these entities. Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys to ensure data integrity. Data types are chosen based on the expected values, considering factors like precision, scale, and potential for future growth. I also prioritize normalization to minimize redundancy and improve data consistency.

4. Q: Describe a situation where you had to optimize a database query for performance. What steps did you take, and what tools or techniques did you use?
 A: At Voosh Food Tech, I needed to optimize a query retrieving menu items based on user preferences and dietary restrictions. I used `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query plan and identified a bottleneck in a large JOIN operation. I then rewrote the query using indexes and materialized views to improve data access speed. I also profiled the query using database monitoring tools to identify further areas for optimization.

5. Q: How do you ensure data integrity and consistency in a database? What are some common techniques and strategies you employ?
 A: Data integrity is crucial. I enforce constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to prevent invalid data entry. I also utilize triggers and stored procedures to automate data validation and enforce business rules. Regular backups and version control are essential for data recovery and consistency.

6. Q: Explain your experience with NoSQL databases like MongoDB. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a NoSQL database compared to a relational database?
 A: I've used MongoDB for projects requiring flexible data models and high scalability. NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, offering horizontal scalability and high availability. However, they may lack the ACID properties and structured querying capabilities of relational databases. My choice depends on the project's data structure and performance requirements.

7. Q: Describe a time when you had to migrate data from one database system to another. What were the challenges, and how did you approach the migration process?
 A: During my time at Alternative Path, I migrated data from a legacy MySQL database to PostgreSQL. The challenge was ensuring data consistency and minimizing downtime during the migration. I used a combination of database replication, ETL processes, and data validation to ensure a smooth transition. I also carefully planned the migration schedule to minimize disruption to ongoing operations.

8. Q: How do you stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the database field?
 A: I actively follow industry blogs, publications, and online communities dedicated to databases. I also participate in online courses and workshops to learn about new technologies and best practices.  I'm particularly interested in cloud-based database solutions, serverless architectures, and the evolving landscape of data management.

9. Q: What are your thoughts on the role of data warehousing and data lakes in modern data analytics?
 A: Data warehousing and data lakes are essential components of modern data analytics. Data warehouses provide a centralized repository for structured data, optimized for analytical queries. Data lakes, on the other hand, store raw data in its native format, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.  The choice between them depends on the specific use case and data characteristics.

10. Q: Explain your understanding of database normalization and its importance in database design. Can you provide an example of a scenario where normalization would be beneficial?
 A: Database normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. For example, in a scenario where you have a table storing customer information and their orders, normalization would involve creating separate tables for customers and orders, linked by a foreign key. This prevents duplicate customer information and ensures data consistency.

SHORT-ANSWER:
1. Q: What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?
 A: A primary key uniquely identifies a row in a table, while a foreign key establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

2. Q: What is ACID in the context of databases?
 A: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, ensuring data integrity in transactions.

3. Q: What is a database index, and how does it improve query performance?
 A: An index is a data structure that speeds up data retrieval by creating a sorted map of values and their corresponding row locations.

4. Q: Name three common database design patterns.
 A: Three common patterns are: star schema, snowflake schema, and fact constellation.

5. Q: What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
 A: SQL databases use structured schemas and relational models, while NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas and various data models.

6. Q: What is data denormalization, and when might it be beneficial?
 A: Denormalization introduces redundancy to improve query performance for read-heavy workloads.

7. Q: What is a database transaction?
 A: A transaction is a logical unit of work that consists of one or more database operations, treated as a single unit.

8. Q: What is the purpose of a database schema?
 A: A schema defines the structure of a database, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships.

9. Q: What is data replication, and why is it important?
 A: Data replication creates copies of data across multiple locations for redundancy, high availability, and disaster recovery.

10. Q: What is a database view, and how is it different from a table?
 A: A view is a virtual table based on a stored SQL query, providing a customized perspective on data without physically storing the results.
